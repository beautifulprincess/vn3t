When a miner has reached a certain amount(difficulty level) he can “submit” a new block to the chain. He use the confirmation algorithm services reconcile all signatures with the Virtualized environment pool associated with the signatures.

In others words, the total supply is divided in two, but market cap is maintained, thus enabling another rounds of mining until next halving, and so on, so forth.</p><p class='faq-h1'>Second angle:</p><p>Each time the a halving is done, the difficulty level of needed signature is raised, to cover to the evolution of data technology and to push on the deflation of the coin overtime.</p>"),
